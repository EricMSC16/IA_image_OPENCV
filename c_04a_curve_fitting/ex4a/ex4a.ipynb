        "In photography and optics, vignetting\u2002is a reduction of an\n",
        "image's brightness or saturation toward the periphery compared\n",
        "to the image center.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mechanical vignetting (for example) occurs when light beams emanating from\n",
        "object points located off-axis are partially blocked by\n",
        "external objects such as thick or stacked filters, secondary\n",
        "lenses, and improper lens hoods. [Wikipedia]\n",
        "\n",
        "Read more about it here:\n",

        "You are an algorithm engineer in a new cutting-edge camera\n",
        "startup with a new problem of automatically correct vignetting problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simple approach:\n",
        "Getting a calibration image of a white wall and then simply divide this calib_im with each raw image to get a fixed image.\n",
        "The problem:\n",
        "Not enough memory in the camera to save multiple calib images per each lens configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "The New process the we propose is as follows:\n",
        "1. For each new lens the end-user wants to use, he will shoot one calibration image of a white wall.\n",
        "2. Calibration params are saved for this lens configuration.\n",
        "3. The user can now work with this lens configuration and the vignetting will be corrected for all images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Behind the scenes we need to build 3 functions:\n",
        "1. `get_index_matrix()` that returns the\n",
        "index matrix (called `X` in our lesson). We will build this in python but our engineers will convert it to ASIC,\n",
        "so this function CAN'T change.\n",
        "2. `get_calib_coeffs(calib_map)` that gets a raw image of the white wall and returns the betta vector (the calibration params).\n",
        "3. `fix_raw_im(b, vig_im)` that gets the user image and the betta vector and fixes the image vignetting.\n",
        "It reconstruct the calib image input from (2) using (1) + betta vector and then divide the input image with this reconstructed calib_map to get a fixed image.\n",
