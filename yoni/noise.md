Gaussian noise is a type of noise that can appear in images due to the electrical circuitry of the system. It is characterized by a probability density function (PDF) that follows a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution. The mathematical equation for the Gaussian PDF is given by:

GAUSSIAN FUNCTION
 

Where $\mu$ is the mean, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $x$ is the pixel value. The Gaussian noise is independent and identically distributed (IID) at each pixel, meaning that the noise is uncorrelated and has the same statistical properties across the image.

The Gaussian noise can be modeled by additive noise, meaning that the noise is added to the original image pixel values. The effect of the noise can be mitigated using various image filtering techniques such as the Gaussian filter.
