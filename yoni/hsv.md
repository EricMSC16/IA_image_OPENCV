We are writing lecture notes for my computer vision course. Write lecture notes with math notations in latex format. Here are some points that needs to be expanded:
HSV
Hue: The "attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them"
Saturation: The "colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness"
Value: The "brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white“. Can also be called brightness or intensity.

In image processing, the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model is a way to represent colors in terms of their attributes of hue, saturation, and value (or brightness). Mathematically, the HSV color model can be represented as:

HSV

HSV=(H,S,V)

where:

$H$ is the hue, which represents the attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them. $H$ is typically represented as an angle in the range $[0, 360]$, where 0 corresponds to red, 120 corresponds to green, and 240 corresponds to blue.

$S$ is the saturation, which represents the colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness. $S$ is typically represented as a value in the range $[0, 1]$, where 0 corresponds to a gray color (no saturation) and 1 corresponds to a fully saturated color.

$V$ is the value (or brightness), which represents the brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white. $V$ is typically represented as a value in the range $[0, 1]$, where 0 corresponds to black and 1 corresponds to white.

It is important to note that the RGB color model represents colors in terms of the amount of red, green, and blue light, while the HSV color model represents colors in terms of hue, saturation, and value. This can make the HSV color model more intuitive to work with in certain image processing tasks, such as color-based object recognition.
