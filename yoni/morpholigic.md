We are writing lecture notes for my computer vision course. Write lecture notes with math notations in latex format. Here are some points that needs to be expanded:morphologic operators.
Each kernel (ùëî) has an anchor point (usually in the kernel center).
Dilation: the final shape is all points where the anchor point can be placed in which the kernel touches a part of the original shape.


Erosion: the final shape is all points where the anchor point can be placed in which all kernel points touch the original shape.
Lecture Notes:

Morphological operators are a set of image processing techniques that process an image based on its shape. These operators are applied to binary images, where the pixels are either black or white. They are typically used to extract specific information from an image, such as removing noise or detecting edges.

The two main morphological operators are dilation and erosion.

Dilation:

Dilation is an operator that expands the shape of an object in an image. It is performed by placing a kernel (g) over the image, with an anchor point (usually at the center of the kernel). The final shape is all points where the anchor point can be placed in which the kernel touches a part of the original shape.

Mathematically, dilation is defined as:

$f_{dilation}(x,y) = \max_{(i,j) \in W} f(x+i,y+j)$

Where $f(x,y)$ is the input image, and $W$ is the neighborhood defined by the kernel.

Erosion:

Erosion is the opposite of dilation; it shrinks the shape of an object in an image. It is performed by placing a kernel (g) over the image, with an anchor point (usually at the center of the kernel). The final shape is all points where the anchor point can be placed in which all kernel points touch the original shape.

Mathematically, erosion is defined as:

$f_{erosion}(x,y) = \min_{(i,j) \in W} f(x+i,y+j)$

Where $f(x,y)$ is the input image, and $W$ is the neighborhood defined by the kernel.

In summary, morphological operators are a set of image processing techniques that are used to extract specific information from an image based on its shape. They are typically used to remove noise or detect edges. The two main morphological operators are dilation and erosion, which expand and shrink the shape of an object in an image, respectively.
