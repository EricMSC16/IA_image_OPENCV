An image can be represented in multiple ways, but one common representation is as a 3-dimensional matrix of discrete RGB values. The matrix has dimensions 𝑛xmx3, where 𝑛 is the width of the image, 𝑚 is the height of the image, and 3 represents the three color channels (red, green, and blue). Each element in the matrix, 𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) , corresponds to the intensity of the 𝑘-th color channel (where 𝑘 ∈ {0,1,2} for R,G,B respectively) at position (𝑖,𝑗) of the image. The values of 𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) are usually of type uint8, which means they are 8-bit unsigned integers ranging from 0 to 255.

Another way to represent an image is as a function, 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦), where 𝑥 and 𝑦 represent the coordinates of a pixel in the image. The output of the function, 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦), is the intensity of the pixel at position (𝑥,𝑦) in the image. This representation is useful for image processing operations that involve mathematical operations on the pixel values.

In summary, an image can be represented as a 3-dimensional matrix of discrete RGB values or a function of 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates. Both representations are used in image processing and computer vision, with the matrix representation being more suitable for storage and display, while the function representation being more suitable for mathematical operations.
