# EX1
Ex1 raw .py files are available for download in a .zip file [(direct download)](https://github.com/YoniChechik/AI_is_Math/raw/master/c_01_intro_to_CV_and_Python/ex1/ex1.zip). Instructions are inside each .py file separately.

This is **a very short assignment**- no more than 20 lines of code...
