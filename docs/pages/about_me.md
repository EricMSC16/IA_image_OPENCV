# About me - Yoni Chechik

Hi!

My name is Yoni Chechik and I'm a consultant and freelancer. I consider myself as an **"AI Architect"**-  helping companies push algo, AI and computer vision pipelines to production. I do both hands-on projects end-to-end and mentorship & consulting for algo teams and C-level executives.

I'm also a **lecturer for computer-vision & AI** at the Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yeffo. Check out my course website at www.AIisMath.com.

Some of my project’s portfolio:
- Buildots: SLAM navigation algorithm R&D with NN.
- Medhub-AI: object detection and semantic segmentation NN for catheterization purposes with X-ray videos.
- ClarityO: image2text consulting.
- Ad-Or Medical: detection of scoliosis (crooked back) via 3D & RGB cameras.
- Ares: stealth mode. Computer-vision & NN freelance and consultancy for something big...
- EyeControl: eye state detection real-time on device for ALS patients.

At the past I’ve completed a **B.Sc. (94 - summa cum laude) & M.Sc. (95) at the Technion** - electrical engineering faculty, and worked as an algo engineer/researcher/tech lead at places like **Intel, Microsoft R&D, VisionMap, and Trigo**.

If your company is interested in a boost of productivity in all aspects of AI & computer vision for research and production, I believe this can be a great fit. I can mentor the algo team or build from scratch algorithms as needed.
