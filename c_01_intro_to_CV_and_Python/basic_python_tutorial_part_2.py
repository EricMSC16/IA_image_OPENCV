#
# ## Control Logics
#
# In the following examples, we show examples of comparison, `if-else` loop, `for` loop, and `while` loop.
# ### Comparison
# Python syntax for comparison is the same as our hand-written convention:
#
# 1. Larger (or equal): `>` (`>=`)
# 2. Smaller (or equal): `<` (`<=`)
# 3. Equal to: `==`
# 4. Not equal to: `!=`

# %%
3 == 5

# %%
72 >= 2

# %%
test_str = "test"
test_str == "test"  # can also compare strings

# %% [markdown]
# ### If-Else

# %%
sum_ = 0


# %%
if sum_ == 0:
    print("sum_ is 0")
elif sum_ < 0:
    print("sum_ is less than 0")
else:
    print("sum_ is above 0 and its value is " + str(sum_))  # Cast sum_ into string type.

# %% [markdown]
# Comparing strings are similar

# %%
store_name = "Walmart"

# %%
if "Wal" in store_name:
    print("The store is not Walmart. It's " + store_name + ".")
else:
    print("The store is Walmart.")

# %% [markdown]
# ### For loop

# %%
for letter in store_name:
    print(letter)

# %% [markdown]
# `range()` is a function to create integer sequences:

# %%
a_range = range(5)
print(a_range)
print("range(5) gives" + str(list(range(5))))  # By default starts from 0
print("range(1,9) gives: " + str(list(range(1, 9))))  # From 1 to 8 (Again the end index is exclusive.)


# %%
for index in range(len(store_name)):  # length of a sequence
    print("The %ith letter in store_name is: %s" % (index, store_name[index]))

# %% [markdown]
# #### List comprehensions
# List comprehensions provides an easy way to create lists:

# %%
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print(x)

# %% [markdown]
# a lot of cool things can be done in one line!

# %%
x = [i + 2 for i in range(10)]
print(x)

x = [i ** 2 for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
print(x)

# %% [markdown]
# ### While loop

# %%
x = 2


# %%
while x < 10:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

# %% [markdown]
# #### Notes on `break` and `continue`
# `break` means get out of the loop immediately. Any code after the `break` will NOT be executed.

# %%
store_name = "Walmart"

# %%
index = 0
while True:
    print(store_name[index])
    index += 1  # a += b means a = a + b
    if store_name[index] == "a":
        print("End at a")
        break  # instead of setting flag to False, we can directly break out of the loop
        print("Hello!")  # This will NOT be run

# %% [markdown]
# `continue` means get to the next iteration of loop. It will __break__ the current iteration and __continue__ to the next.

# %%
for letter in store_name:
    if letter == "a":
        continue  # Not printing a
    else:
        print(letter)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Functions
# Structure of a function
# ```python
# def func_name(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...):
#     #####################
#     # Do something here #
#     #####################
#     return output
# ```
#
# return output` is **NOT** required
# ###One input one output

# %%
def F(n):  # bonus- what does this function do?
    if n < 0:
        print("Incorrect input")
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)


# %%
print(F(2))

print(F(3))

print(F(5))

print(F(7))

# %% [markdown]
# ###Multiple outputs
# reference- geometric sequence equations:
#
# $a_n = a_1 \cdot q^{n-1}$
#
# $S_n = \frac{a_1\cdot(q^n-1)}{q-1}$

# %%
def geo_seq(a_1, q, n):
    a_n = a_1 * (q ** (n - 1))
    S_n = (a_1 * (q ** n - 1)) / (q - 1)
    return a_n, S_n


# %%
print(geo_seq(2, 2, 1))  # multiple outputs returns as a tuple

print(geo_seq(2, 2, 2))

print(geo_seq(2, 2, 2))

print(geo_seq(2, 2, 3)[1])  # get only second element

# %% [markdown]
# ### optional args

# %%
def geo_seq_optional_args(a_1, q=2, n=1):
    a_n = a_1 * (q ** (n - 1))
    S_n = (a_1 * (q ** n - 1)) / (q - 1)
    return a_n, S_n


# %%
print(geo_seq_optional_args(2))

print(geo_seq_optional_args(2, n=2))

# %% [markdown]
# ##Classes
# As been said before- Python is object oriented programing (OOP) language, so every variable is actually an instance of some class.
#
# Here are some class basics:

# %%
class Employee:

    # the function that is being called each time a new instance is created
    def __init__(self, name="Jhon", salary=10000):
        # per instance variables
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    def display_employee(self):
        print("Name : " + self.name + ", Salary: " + str(self.salary))

    def change_salary(self, new_salary):
        self.salary = new_salary


# %%
emp1 = Employee()  # create new instance
emp1.display_employee()

emp2 = Employee("Bob", salary=20000)  # create new instance
emp2.display_employee()

emp2.change_salary(30000)
emp2.display_employee()

# instance variables are also accessible - no such thing private/public vars
emp2.name = "Larry"
emp2.display_employee()

# %% [markdown]
# ## FIle I/O
# This section is about some basics on reading and writing data, in Python native style
# ### Write data to a file

# %%
f = open("tmp1.csv", "w")  # f is a file handler, while "w" is the mode (w for write)
for item in range(6):
    f.write(str(item) + "\n")
f.close()  # close the filer handler for security reasons.

# %% [markdown]
# *Note that without the typecasting from `int` to `str`, an error will be raised.*
# A more commonly used way:

# %%
with open("tmp2.csv", "w") as f:
    for item in range(4):
        f.write(str(item))
        f.write("\n")
# no need to close file, when out of 'with' scope the file closes automatically


# %% [markdown]
# Occasionally, we need to _append new elements_ instead of _overwriting_ existing files. In this case, we should use `a` mode in our `open` function:

# %%
with open("tmp2.csv", "a") as f:  # 'a' == append to end of file
    for item in range(15, 19):
        f.write(str(item) + "\n")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Read data to a file
# To read a text file into Python, we use `r` mode (for _read_)

# %%
f = open("tmp1.csv", "r")  # this time, use read mode
contents = [
    item.strip("\n") for item in f
]  # list comprehension. This is the same as for-loop but more concise + stripping newline
print(contents)
f.close()

# %% [markdown]
# Also using `with`:

# %%
with open("tmp2.csv", "r") as f:
    print(f.readlines())

# %%
# delete the files...
import os

os.remove("tmp1.csv")
os.remove("tmp2.csv")
# %% [markdown]
# ## Packages
# Often times, we need either internal or external help for complicated computation tasks. In these occasions, we need to _import packages_.
# ### Built-in packages
# Python provides many built-in packages to prevent extra work on some common and useful functions
#
# We will use __math__ as an example.

# %%
import math  # use import to load a library

# %% [markdown]
# To use functions from the library, do: `library_name.function_name`. For example, when we want to calculate the logarithm using a function from `math` library, we can do `math.log`

# %%
x = 3
print("e^x = e^3 = %f" % math.exp(x))
print("log(x) = log(3) = %f" % math.log(x))

# %% [markdown]
# You can also import one specific function:

# %%
from math import exp  # You can import a specific function

print(exp(x))  # This way, you don't need to use math.exp but just exp

# %% [markdown]
# Or all:

# %%
from math import *  # Import all functions - not recommended do to overriding of functions

# %%
print(exp(x))
print(log(x))  # Before importing math, calling `exp` or `log` will raise errors

# %% [markdown]
# You can import a package with a shortened name:

# %%
import math as m

m.exp(3)

# %% [markdown]
# Depending on what you want to achieve, you may want to choose between importing a few or all (by `*`) functions within a package.
# ### External Packages
# There are times you'll want some advanced utility functions not provided by Python. There are many useful packages by developers.
#
# We'll use __numpy__ as an example. (__numpy__, __scipy__, __matplotlib__,and probably __pandas__ will be of the most importance to you for data analyses.
#
# Installation of packages for Python is the easiest using <a href="https://packaging.python.org/installing/" target="_blank">pip</a>:
# ```bash
# ~$ pip install numpy
# ```
# We'll see use for external packages later on.
